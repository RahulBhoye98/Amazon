Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, we delve into analyzing sales
data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and
uncover valuable insights from the dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project representing Amazon sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,
products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
missing values and ensure data quality.

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the relationships between
the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.


## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into Amazon sales trends, customer
preferences, and other factors influencing e-commerce operations. By analyzing the dataset
and addressing the key questions, we hope to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions
and optimizing their sales strategies.
